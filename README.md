# mlb

Simple code sample using vanilla Javascript, Webpack, and SASS.

User can use left/right arrows to scroll through MLB games and the enter key to view details

The site was bundled by Webpack, so you may simply navigate to the /dist folder and run the index.html file locally.  Please make sure you are connected to the internet as this web application makes an API call to collect MLB game recaps data from the previous night (choosing games from the current day are only useful if games have already completed, so I made the decision to choose games from the day before).
